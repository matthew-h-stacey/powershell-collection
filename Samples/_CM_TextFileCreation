Objective: Create a text file in CM with a list of strings to perform a foreach operation (ex: text file with UserPrincipalNames)

1. Prepare your CSV/TXT file on your own PC with the list of strings

2. Access CloudManager console

3. Navigate to your user folder
cd /cloud-manager/users/{YourUserName}

4. From that directory, use "cat" to create the text file and start piping input
cat > UserPrincipalNames.txt

5. Paste in the list of strings from step #1

6. CTRL+C to break out and finish creating the file

7. Test. Either view the contents of the entire file, or check a specific value in the array
    Test #1: 
    cat UserPrincipalNames.txt

    Test #2:
    $UPNs = Get-Content UserPrincipalNames.txt
    $UPNs[2]

8. Run your commands
$UPNs = Get-Content UserPrincipalNames.txt
foreach ( $UPN in $UPNs ) { # commands here }
